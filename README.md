This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Structure

**Tech Stack:**

- Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Material Tailwind for UI components

**Key Files:**

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main React component with UI layout and component logic
- `src/app/data.ts` - Data models and exported arrays for work experience, projects, and skills
- `public/img/` - All images and SVG assets
- `public/favicon.ico` - Site favicon
- `.nvmrc` - Node version specification
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration file. Theme colors can be configured here
- `.github` â€“ GitHub Actions configurations

**Data Flow:**

- `data.ts` exports typed arrays (WORK_EXPERIENCES, PERSONAL_PROJECTS, etc.)
- `page.tsx` imports and maps over these arrays to render accordions and chips
- Images referenced in data arrays are served from `public/img/`

5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser, and make changes to see them
